YOU WILL NEED:

1 large sweet potato
Toppings
Salt
1 teaspoon crushed pink peppercorns
¼ red onion, finely diced
Vegan cheddar cheese
Cashew cream cheese
Olives, roughly cut
Roasted red peppers, sliced into strips
Pickled radish and carrots
Fresh basil leaves

DIRECTIONS:

Preheat oven to 220°C.
Bake the sweet potato in the oven for about 2 hours. (If you're using a smaller or mid-sized potato, check on it after an hour or so to ensure it doesn't burn.)
Slice your sweet potato down the middle, lengthwise, being extra careful as it will be steaming hot!
Season with salt and pink peppercorns, and serve with your favourite toppings

Variation: Some other great toppings include roasted chickpeas, chopped walnuts or toasted pepitas.
